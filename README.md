** Limitations **

Some of the limitations I experienced were from taking so long to understand and learning the front-end knowledge necessary to complete the assignment. A majority of my time was trying to learn how to actually code what I wanted. In retrospect, I should've started earlier to make up for the learning curve of using this library.
In terms of my design I was not able to include the timedate components so that it resembled the example. I also failed to remove the total power in the bar chart and alter the toggle switch so that it resembled the example. For the most part, my design did not capture the details that were necessary to replicate what we were given.
There is a lot of code that I did not end up needing that I did not clean up due to my lack of time-management.

The zingcharts example was the most useful reference as it helped me build a general structure for my .js code. The links above were used to create the following: bar charts, donut charts, button toggles, the on-mouse event, synchronized charts, as well as many other aspects.

** General Comments **
The dashboard helped me improve my JS skills and think through how to approach a build like this. Not having a step-by-step guide was a different experience and there was quite a bit of time spent googling and trying to find answers that didn't directly apply to this assignment, but when thought through were quite useful. The critical thinking involved was at time very frustrating but made for a more satisfying experience when things finally worked.
